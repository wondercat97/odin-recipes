        <h2>Making the juiciest burger ever!</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese (such as Kraft®)</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well. Form 8, thin patties from the beef. Each patty should be slightly larger than a slice of cheese.</li>
            <li>Cut each slice of American cheese into 4 equal pieces; stack the pieces. Sandwich one stack of cheese between 2 ground beef patties. Tightly pinch edges together tightly seal the cheese within the meat. Repeat with the remaining cheese and patties.</li>
            <li>Preheat a cast-iron or other heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. Cook burgers until well browned, about 4 minutes. It is common for burgers to puff up due to steam from the melting cheese. Turn burgers and prick the top of each to allow steam to escape; cook until browned on the outside and no longer pink on the inside; about 4 minutes. Serve on hamburger buns.</li>
        </ol>
